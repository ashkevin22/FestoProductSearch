## Grading Note
- There is not a lot of code in the repo because we only very recently got all of the components and access that we need from Festo. We began frontend development and they said that they had components that we should use, which took a while for us to actually get (recieved them the week of December 3rd).
- As for backend, we have still been research and talking to people about solutions (specifically VizSeek), so there is not any backend code yet.
- Infrastructure also has the same problem of only recently recieving the AWS access that we needed (same week as the frontend components).
